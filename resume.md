# Experience

## UMN Networking Research Group | Mar 2022 – Jul 2022
### Research Assistant
* Conducted experiments using network diagnosis tools to measure the performance of commercial 5G network and simulate the scheduling algorithm of the base station.
* Data analysis/visualization using python scripts, using libraries such as pandas and seaborn. Collected and processed real world coordinates into GeoTile data. Generated reports on Wireless 5G signal strengths based on geo locations and network load.

## UMN Computer Vision Lab | Apr 2021 – May 2022
### Data Analyst & Recruiter
* Designed python scripts applying machine learning and computer graphics and using Tensorflow framework to implement an automated masking program. Processing video data using automated annotation tool to mask any sensitive content in the raw data and enhance the video quality. Collected and processed video data can be found in Ego4D project.
* Process, label, and upload data to UMN supercomputer, utilized automated scheduling algorithm to facilitate process efficiency. 
* Lead recruitment and video processing for the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. Host virtual meeting with participants and distribute/recycle experiment tools such as video capture glasses and equipment calibration. Coordinate in-person experiments with motion capture and video equipment.

## Center for Speech and Language Technologies | Jun 2019 – Aug 2019
### Research Assistant
* Developed Accent ID system for the lab’s projects, the revised model after training later is integrated in to the NSFC program for voice recognition.
* Collected various of accent audio data with geo-specific infromation. Hands on experience using machine learning and NLP to achieve automated system. Applied multiple modules to create a classification script that could distinguish different dialects using their characteristic wave matrix.

# Project

## Egocentric Live 4D Perception (Ego4D)
* https://ai.facebook.com/tools/ego4d 
* A massive-scale, egocentric dataset and benchmark suite collected across 74 worldwide locations and 9 countries, with over 3,670 hours of daily-life activity video. Formulating computer vision benchmark challenges, including future prediction and social interactions.
* In collaboration with other research facilities, universities, and Facebook Reality Labs Research (FRL).

## Dialect-Identification
* https://github.com/silongtan/ML-Project-Accent-ID
* Applied machine learning algorithms (KNN) to build a dialects database and a dialect-identification system after transforming the raw audio data using MFCC. After training, this system has an accuracy of 60% in identification.
